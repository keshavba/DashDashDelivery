# Dash Dash Delivery

Hello! Dash Dash Delivery is an educational game on financial literacy primarily for students on the autism spectrum. I worked on this game from September 2020 to June 2021 as part of a team of 10 members. This research project was led by Professors Benjamin Wagley and Amandeep Dhaliwal at The University of Texas at Arlington. I developed several systems for this game, such as the time, purchasing, and character customization systems. I also worked on a couple of in-game arcade games. This repository contains the code I wrote for the game. This game has been published to Steam, and you can find it here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1661800/Dash_Dash_Delivery/.
